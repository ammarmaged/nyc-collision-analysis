# nyc-collision-analysis
A complete data engineering process using a real-world dataset on  motor vehicle collisions in New York City. 
1. Dataset Processing Contributions

-Ammar Maged

Performed initial data exploration for both datasets.

Handled missing values.

Executed and validated the merging of the two datasets.

-Mahmoud Ayman Khalil

Detected and analyzed outliers across both datasets.

-Documented the dataset merging workflow and data exploration findings.

Abd Elrahman Nazmy

-Removed duplicate records.

Identified and handled new missing values created after joining datasets.

-Adham Bahaa

Standardized data formats.

Cleaned inconsistent or redundant columns to ensure schema consistency.

-Omar Bassem

Ensured proper data type formatting and corrected mismatches.

Contributed to standardizing remaining inconsistencies in the dataset structure.

2. Website Development Contributions

-Ammar Maged

Responsible for deployment setup and configuration.

-Mahmoud Ayman Khalil

Developed the initial implementation of the website.

-Abd Elrahman Nazmy

Worked on front-end design and user interface development.

-Adham Bahaa

Reviewed all research questions and ensured accurate representation on the website.

-Omar Bassem

Selected and designed the visualizations used throughout the website.

Deployment:
we used hugging faces for the deploymnet instead of vercel or render as the dataset is too large and the free plan of  them doesn't give you enough ram to handle it.

https://ammarmaged-nyc-collision-analysis.hf.space this is the deployment link (the website is huge so when click genertae report it require 3-4 minutes ti generate it)
